# OrganizeApp
An app that helps users organize their tasks, giving them the ability to add, edit, delete and complete the tasks. There is also a page of statistics that helps the user view their progress.

# Technical Description
The login is implemented with Google OAuth 2.0 Authentication, which means that the user should have a Google Account in order to log in. The front end of the application is implemented
from scratch using HTML, CSS, Materialize (CSS Framework) and Handlebars. To add more the graphics of the statistics of the app were illustrated with the help of Plotly.
Also, Axios was used for HTTP requests from the browser. Finally, for the back end, Node.js, Express and MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database, were used.
